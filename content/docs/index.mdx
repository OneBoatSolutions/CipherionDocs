# Cipherion
**Quantum Resilient • Zero Trust • Zero Compromise**
Enterprise-grade security built for a post-quantum world — Cipherion protects your most sensitive data at the field level, in motion and at rest.

## Built for Data Security and Gen AI Privacy
Cipherion is a next-generation Encryption-as-a-Service (EaaS) platform that integrates seamlessly into your systems. With real-time data masking, tokenization, and quantum-resistant architecture, we help you stay compliant, secure, and future-proof — no key storage required.

## Compliance Ready
Cipherion not just encrypts your data, but makes you compliance ready. Built for enterprises that demand zero compromise on data security.

> Cipherion isn't just another encryption layer — it's a complete security fabric.

Cipherion is developing advanced data protection technology for modern digital ecosystems. It enables secure communication and storage without relying on traditional key systems. The platform works across industries to ensure privacy, compliance, and resilience against cyber threats. It integrates easily with existing software and infrastructure, offering developers simple tools for strong security. Cipherion's mission is to make enterprise-grade encryption accessible, seamless, and future-ready.

## Key Features of Cipherion

Built for enterprises that demand zero compromise on data security.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Quantum-Resilient Encryption" icon={<Shield />}>
    Uses advanced cryptographic models designed to resist quantum attacks. Secure against Shor's and Grover's algorithms.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Field-Level Encryption" icon={<Lock />}>
    Encrypt individual data fields like names, emails, card numbers, EMRs, etc. Enables selective access and minimizes blast radius in case of breach.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Dynamic Tokenization & PII Masking" icon={<Eye />}>
    Replace sensitive fields with non-reversible tokens or masked values. Ensures compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Zero Key Storage Architecture" icon={<Key />}>
    No need to store or rotate encryption keys. Cipherion dynamically derives encryption context from input.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="REST & gRPC APIs for Developers" icon={<Code />}>
    Lightweight, plug-and-play API integrations. Built with OpenAPI standards and supports token-based authentication.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Real-Time Audit Logging" icon={<FileText />}>
    Track every access, mutation, and request involving sensitive data. Generate reports for internal review or third-party audits.
  </Card>




  <Card title="Inline Data Protection Without Code Refactor" icon={<Zap />}>
    Encrypt, tokenize, or mask sensitive fields directly inside existing forms, APIs, and database flows — no need to redesign your application logic.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Cross-Border Compliance Mode" icon={<Globe />}>
    Adapts to country-specific regulations dynamically (e.g., GDPR vs. HIPAA). Localized masking/encryption logic for multi-region deployment.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Format-Consistent Analytics Compatibility" icon={<Lock />}>
    Tokenized or masked data retains structure and data types, enabling continued use in dashboards, BI tools, and machine-learning workflows without data leakage.
  </Card>

  <Card title="On-Prem & Cloud-Agnostic Deployment" icon={<Server />}>
    Deploy Cipherion wherever your systems are — cloud-native, hybrid, or fully on-prem — with no vendor lock-in.
  </Card>
</Cards>
