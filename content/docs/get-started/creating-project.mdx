# Creating a Project

Set up your first Cipherion project and configure security policies to start protecting your data.

<Callout title="Prerequisites">
Ensure your account setup is complete and you have organization admin privileges.
</Callout>

## Project Creation Process

<Steps>
<Step>
### Initialize New Project

Create and name your encryption project

1. Navigate to the Projects dashboard in your Cipherion console
2. Click "Create New Project" button
3. Enter a descriptive project name (e.g., "Customer Data Protection", "Medical Records Encryption")
4. Add optional project description and tags for organization
5. Select your project environment

#### Project Naming Best Practices

- Use descriptive names that indicate the data type or use case
- Include environment indicators
- Keep names concise but meaningful
- Avoid special characters or spaces
</Step>

<Step>
### Data Classification Setup (Coming Soon...)

Define data types and sensitivity levels

#### Configure Data Types:

**Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**  
Names • Emails • Phone Numbers • Addresses

**Payment Card Information (PCI)**  
Card Numbers • CVV • Expiry Dates

**Protected Health Information (PHI)**  
Medical Records • Patient IDs • Diagnoses

**Financial Data**  
Account Numbers • SSN • Tax IDs
</Step>

<Step>
### Security Policy Configuration (Coming Soon...)

Set encryption methods and access controls

#### Encryption Methods

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-4">
  <div className="border rounded-lg p-4 dark:border-gray-700">
    <strong>Field-Level Encryption</strong> (Recommended)
  </div>
  <div className="border rounded-lg p-4 dark:border-gray-700">
    <strong>Dynamic Tokenization</strong>
  </div>
  <div className="border rounded-lg p-4 dark:border-gray-700">
    <strong>Format-Preserving Encryption</strong>
  </div>
  <div className="border rounded-lg p-4 dark:border-gray-700">
    <strong>Data Masking</strong>
  </div>
</div>

#### Access Control Settings

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- IP whitelisting
- Time-based access restrictions
- Audit logging enabled
</Step>

<Step>
### Compliance & Data Residency (Coming Soon...)

Configure regulatory compliance and data location requirements

#### Compliance Frameworks

<Cards>
  <Card title="GDPR" icon={<Shield />}>
    EU General Data Protection Regulation
  </Card>
  <Card title="HIPAA" icon={<HeartPlus />}>
    Health Insurance Portability Act
  </Card>
  <Card title="CreditCard" icon={<CreditCard />}>
    Payment Card Industry Standards
  </Card>
  <Card title="SOX" icon={<FileText />}>
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act
  </Card>
</Cards>

#### Data Residency Options

Select a region where your data will be processed and stored.
</Step>

<Step>
### Project Finalization

Review settings and activate your project

**Final Review Checklist:**
- ✓ Project name and description configured
- ✓ Data classification and sensitivity levels defined
- ✓ Security policies and encryption methods selected
- ✓ Compliance frameworks and data residency configured
- ✓ Access controls and audit settings enabled
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="success" title="Project Created Successfully!">
Your project is now ready for API key generation and integration.

**Project ID:** `proj_abc123def456ghi789`
</Callout>

## Best Practices for Project Setup

Tips to optimize your Cipherion project configuration

### Security Configuration

- Always enable audit logging for compliance and monitoring
- Use the most restrictive access controls that still allow your application to function
- Regularly review and update your security policies

### Data Classification

- Start with a conservative approach—you can always relax restrictions later
- Clearly document what data types are included in each classification
- Consider future data types your application might handle

## What Next?

Now that your project is created, proceed to generate API keys to start integrating Cipherion with your applications.
