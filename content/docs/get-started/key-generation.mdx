# Key Generation by Passphrase

Learn how to generate secure encryption keys using passphrases with Cipherion's zero-key-storage architecture.

## Zero-Key-Storage Architecture

Understanding how Cipherion generates keys without storing them

Cipherion's revolutionary approach eliminates the need to store encryption keys. Instead, keys are dynamically derived from secure passphrases and context information, providing quantum-resistant security without the overhead of key management infrastructure.

### Benefits

- **No key storage vulnerabilities** - Keys are never stored anywhere
- **Simplified key rotation** - Just change your passphrase
- **Quantum-resistant encryption** - Advanced cryptographic algorithms
- **Reduced attack surface** - No key database to compromise

### How It Works

- Passphrase + context = unique key
- Keys generated on-demand
- No persistent key storage
- Deterministic key derivation

## Passphrase Generation Process

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a Strong Passphrase

Generate a secure passphrase for key derivation

<Callout type="info" title="Passphrase Strength">
Consider making your passphrase longer and including a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
</Callout>

**Example Strong Passphrase:**
```
Correct-Horse-Battery-Staple-2024!
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Passphrase Requirements

Security guidelines for creating strong passphrases

#### Minimum Requirements

- At least 12 characters long
- Contains uppercase letters
- Contains lowercase letters
- Contains numbers
- Contains special characters

#### Best Practices

- Use a passphrase instead of a password
- Combine multiple unrelated words
- Add numbers and symbols naturally
- Avoid personal information
- Don't reuse existing passwords
- Consider using a password manager
</Step>

<Step>
### Key Derivation Process

How Cipherion generates keys from your passphrase

#### Input Components

- **Passphrase:** Your master passphrase
- **Context:** Data field identifier
- **Salt:** Cryptographic salt
- **Project ID:** Your project identifier

#### Security Features

- 100,000+ PBKDF2 iterations
- SHA-512 cryptographic hashing
- Unique salt per operation
- Context-aware key generation
</Step>

### Implementation Example

How to use passphrase-based key generation in your application

#### API Request Example

```bash
POST /v1/encrypt
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": "john.doe@example.com",
  "data_type": "email"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "encrypted_data": "cph_encrypted_data_here",
  "data_type": "email",
  "request_id": "req_abc123"
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Security Considerations

Important security practices for passphrase management

### ✅ Do's

- Store passphrases securely (password managers)
- Keep changing passphrases for every alternative month
- Use unique passphrases for different projects
- Implement passphrase rotation policies
- Use hardware security modules when possible
- Enable audit logging for all operations

### ❌ Don'ts

- Never hardcode passphrases in source code
- Don't transmit passphrases over insecure channels
- Avoid using personal information in passphrases
- Don't share passphrases between team members
- Never log passphrases in application logs

## Advanced Key Generation Features

Additional options for enterprise security

### Multi-Factor Key Generation

Combine multiple authentication factors for enhanced security:

- Passphrase + Hardware Token
- Passphrase + Biometric Authentication
- Passphrase + Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)

### Key Derivation Customization

```json
{
  "passphrase": "your-passphrase",
  "iterations": 150000,
  "salt_length": 32,
  "key_length": 256,
  "hash_algorithm": "SHA-512"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions

### Weak Passphrase Error
Ensure your passphrase meets all security requirements listed above.

### Key Derivation Timeout
This may occur with very long passphrases or high iteration counts. Consider optimizing your settings.

### Context Mismatch
Ensure the same context is used for encryption and decryption operations.
