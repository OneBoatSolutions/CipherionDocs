## Testing Your API Key

Verify your API key is working correctly

### Quick Test with cURL

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.cipherion.com/v1/encrypt \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": "test@example.com",
    "data_type": "email"
  }'
```

### Expected Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "encrypted_data": "cph_encrypted_...",
  "data_type": "email",
  "encryption_method": "field_level",
  "request_id": "req_123456789"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions

### 401 Unauthorized Error
Check that your API key is correctly formatted and has the required permissions.
